# Eye_disease_detection
Overview:
This project implements an ensemble model combining ResNet50, VGG19, and EfficientNet-b0 using a weighted average for eye image classification. The trained model is deployed through a FastAPI-based API for prediction, and a user-friendly web application built using the MERN stack integrates with this model to provide predictions.
